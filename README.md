# phpTest
<h2>Application Test</h2>
I took this test as a part of an application. There was a time limit of 24 hrs to complete the project<br />
-- Here was the original specification document --<br />
Create a web application in PHP that meets the following requirements:<br />
<ol>
<li>Presents the following three questions to a user and collects their input.</li>
<ul>
<li>What is your name?</li>
<li>What is your favorite color?</li>
<li>What is your favorite food?</li>
</ul>
<li>Saves the responses to a CSV file. This file should accumulate responses as more people
take the survey.</li>
<li>Displays the responses from the survey on a web page. You may display the data however
you think is best.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You may use HTML, JavaScript, CSS and images if you want to, but the core application
must be written in PHP.</li>
<li>Please submit your application in a .zip file.</li>
</ul>
-- end of specifications --<br />
All told, between the experimentation and testing, I spent about 5 hours on it. When I returned the project, 
I had this in the accompanying email.
<p>Here is the test back to you. Since the emphasis on the instructions was to do the php, that is all I did. 
This doesn't contain most of the stuff I would could have added 
(form validation, input security, pretty output) but that wasn't on the specifications.</p>
